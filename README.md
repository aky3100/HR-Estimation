The dataset consists of recordings from 22 adult subjects, primarily aged between 20 and 23, of Asian ethnicity. The measurements were conducted indoors at a temperature range of 26–27°C and a relative humidity of 45–55%. The camera primarily focused on capturing the subject's face, maintaining a distance of less than 1 meter. Data was captured using a USB webcam with a nominal sampling rate of 25 frames per second and a resolution of 640×480.
