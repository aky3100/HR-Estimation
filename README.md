The dataset includes recordings from 22 adult subjects, predominantly aged 20 to 23 and of Asian ethnicity. Measurements were performed indoors under controlled conditions, with a temperature range of 26–27°C and a relative humidity of 45–55%. The camera focused primarily on the subject's face, maintaining a distance of less than 1 meter. Data was captured using a USB webcam with a nominal sampling rate of 25 fps and a resolution of 640×480.
